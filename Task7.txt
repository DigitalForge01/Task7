Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions


1: Open the Extensions/Add-ons Manager

Chrome/Edge/Brave: Go to the menu (⋮ or ⋯) → More Tools → Extensions, or simply type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.


2: Review All Installed Extensions

Scan the list of installed extensions one by one.
Flag any that you don’t recognize or no longer use. Unused or outdated extensions pose security and performance risks.


3: Check Permissions and Reviews

Click Details or view the Permissions tab to see what each extension can access—browser history, all websites, clipboard, etc. 
Read user reviews and check when it was last updated. Be particularly wary of excessive permissions from extensions that don't need them.


4: Identify Unused or Suspicious Extensions

Look for these red flags:

Installed without your awareness or suddenly appeared.
Permissions that seem unnecessary.
Unmaintained or outdated (no recent updates).
Poor reviews or news mentions of malicious behavior 


5: Remove Suspicious or Unused Extensions

Click Remove (or Uninstall) on flagged extensions.
For Windows Chrome, you can also enable Developer Mode to locate and delete extension folder.


6: Restart Browser & Check Performance

Close and relaunch your browser to ensure removed extensions are fully cleared.
Monitor its speed and responsiveness—expect smoother startup times and quicker page loads without extension overhead.


7: Understand Extension Threats

Malicious extensions can:

Steal credentials, session tokens, clipboard content, or browsing history.
Inject ads, redirect your traffic, or install trojans. 
Harvest browsing data for profit or botnet activities.
Slow down your browser, consume resources, or exploit outdated code.
